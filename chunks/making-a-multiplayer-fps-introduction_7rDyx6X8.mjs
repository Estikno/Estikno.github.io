This is because it is the game engine I know the most, and even though it would be beneficial to try other ones, I think that I would have a difficult time developing the game than additionally having to learn a new engine like Unreal Engine or Godot.\n\nIt's also important to consider that Unity is the most popular one, so there is a lot of documentation which will be helpful in my journey as I never developed a multiplayer game before.\n\n## Riptide as the networking library:\n\nFor the multiplayer aspect of my FPS game, I'll be utilizing a new library called <a href=\"https://riptide.tomweiland.net\" target=\"_blank\">Riptide</a>, developed by the talented <a href=\"https://tomweiland.net\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Weilland</a>.\n\nThis lightweight library is designed to be used in networking in Unity as well as in all over `.NET`. The library gives you low-level control of the networking stuff which is excellent, but everything has a catch; in this case, you are responsible for organizing the messages IDs, protocol methods, and everything else needed. This may seem tedious and confusing, but the amount of power you have means that you can implement basically anything you need.\n\nOn the other hand, a library like <a href=\"https://mirror-networking.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mirror</a> is a lot easier and intuitive to use; however, it is very difficult to add new things that the library doesn't have. So you have to evaluate which one suits better your needs.\n\n## Connection Between Server and Clients:\n\nOne of the core elements that I've already set up is the connection between the server and clients. As I didn't know basically anything about networking, I followed Tom Weiland's <a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXkn83W0Qkfn3qF7NU4OEtVwOD6U2wphJ&si=eoihff4o-7MEDrZv\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial series</a> on how to set up basic networking stuff needed for the game. You should check it out as well; it's very well explained and easy to understand.\n\n![connection](../../assets/blog/Making_a_multiplayer_fps/1/connection.webp)\n\n## What to Expect:\n\nThroughout this blog series, I'll be sharing every step of my game development process. From the initial concept and design phase to coding, artwork, level creation, playtesting, and debugging, you'll witness the challenges and triumphs of my journey. I'll also document the lessons I learn, the valuable resources I find, and any tips and tricks that could be useful for fellow aspiring game developers.\n\nIt is important to understand that this series is `not a tutorial one`. However, you will see how it is to work behind a project like this one.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nI intend to share updates on this project approximately every two weeks, but don't expect too much as in September I start my baccalaureate, and I don't think I will have a lot of free time. I will continue to post at least on some weekends though.\n\nThank you for joining me on this adventure, and I look forward to your support and feedback throughout this exciting process!";
